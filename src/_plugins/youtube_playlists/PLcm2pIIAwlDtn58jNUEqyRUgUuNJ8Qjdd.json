What will it look like to have that decentralised, citizen powered and unbiased by demographics? Andy Crowe and Rui Peng's idea is to see underprivileged communities embrace their diversity and become powerhouses of innovation. This has upended their values, blown apart their assumptions, and given them an understanding of innovation as a force for good. Andy co-founded Critical. Design in 2013 with Rui Peng, aimed at democratising manufacturing. The Design Lab is located inside decile 1 Wesley Intermediate School and brings tech such as 3D design and printing, robotics and CNC milling to their students and community. Andy has supported innovative initiatives in the education sector and continues to help teachers to think outside of the box to best prepare students for an unknown future. He has harnessed this experience to drive the social innovation initiatives that Critical pursues.\n\nRui Peng is a husband, father, social entrepreneur, designer, maker, architect, technology enthusiast, and a man with a big mission. The question that guides his work and life is: ‘How can I align my deepest desire with the world’s deepest need?’ As a young designer based in the low socioeconomic neighbourhood of Mt Roskill, he is searching for the “sweet spot” where his talents can be directed towards empowering his neighbours to gain the skills and resources they need to determine their own futures. He co-founded Critical. Design in 2013 and right now, he’s working through the immense challenges that come with making the dream of the social entrepreneur a reality.

Executing this novel methodology very quickly yielded two new award winning AI startups of international repute. It's an original business contribution, of ground up collaboration with one’s competitor, that has large significance and applicability to anyone in the field of entrepreneurship, democratising technologies, and corporate innovation. Drawn from his exec-experience in high profile tech companies and venture capital, we hear a casual and light hearted distillation of how to create unfair advantage in business; an ecosystem where the majority's status quo is to disrupt or compete with one another in isolation.  Shaveer Mirpuri is in the business of disruptive startups with the purpose of driving innovation. Upon his return to New Zealand, Shaveer formed GOAT Ventures which co-invests and co-creates companies with Fortune 500 corporates. He believes pairing radically opposite companies will create opportunities others could only dream of.\n\nHe’s been involved in hugely successful startups such as Wooga which grew to 300 staff and raised $24 million, he’s taken lead mentoring roles. He’s also personally consulted the CEO of Walmart on artificial intelligence strategy and German Chancellor Angela Merkel on innovation.

How can we use this “companion plant” to benefit society? Founder of the hemp seed food product company, Plant Culture, Cameron Sims explores these questions, detailing the history of hemp prohibition, and how this has held society back from being more sustainable. Cameron lists the many benefits and uses of hemp, from eating it for breakfast to building environmentally friendly houses, showing us how we can begin harnessing the power of hemp pragmatically in order to improve our own lives and the world around us.    Cameron Sims believes the simple ingredient hemp, is the key to changing the world and helping humanity become more sustainable. As a Kiwi raised on a sheep and beef farm, he became New Zealand’s first hemp-based chef.\n\nCameron’s company Plant Culture encourages and supports consumers to be environmentally friendly. His ultimate goal is to create a modern and biodynamic university campus to reintroduce biodiversity back into our cities and soils. Cameron’s passions are plant-based cuisine, art, nature, environmental enterprise, adventure, extreme sports, meditation, breathing, yoga and people.

Sam looks at how being a conscious consumer can and has changed the way corporations run themselves for the better, taking power away from some of the most significant businesses that influence our society, and giving it back to the people who should. Sam Stubbs is the founder of non profit KiwiSaver fund Simplicity. Sam’s career spans politics, philosophy, technology and finance. He believes the finance industry should be as much a force for good as a source of profit which he thinks can be achieved by companies embracing long term thinking, sustainability and full diversity.\n\nSam’s primary passion is being the best son, partner and dad and he will most likely be found on the water trying ski, surf and sail.

Anna Faber’s psychoanalytic research of South Korean media, it’s inception, development, and success draws controversial and challenging ideas about the impact of the industry on contemporary society, and its significance in the foundation of a nationwide establishment of normativity.\n Anna Faber is a Master’s student at The University of Auckland researching the interaction between the US and Asia within a film context. In particular, her world-first research explores the impact South Korean film and media has on South Korean society. Notoriously censored in the past, South Korean film has underscored major political movements and provided somewhat of a guideline to South Korean existence.\n\nAnna was awarded a first class honours degree in which she undertook various studies in feminist film theory and documentary-making in addition to a dissertation on the concept of borders in South Korean horror film.

It is the place between something stopping and something beginning, the hardest part is making the change stick. In this talk Nigel Parker shares a personal story of change where he creates a digital assistant that passively collects his health data and makes predictions when he is going off track. The assistant can predict when he is getting stressed or fighting a virus, and can give him a nudge at the right place and right time to adjust his behaviours. Nigel Parker is chief engineer for Microsoft Asia’s Commercial Software Engineering. His job is to seek out solutions to hard problems. But for him, it’s not just about the technology, it’s about the impact technology can have on people’s lives. In his own personal project, Nigel set about using technology to turn his health around and create better, stable habits.\n\nNigel believes as machine intelligence becomes more developed, humans must make sure they keep up and build symbiotic intelligence to expand human capability in ways that are both tangible and magical.

Instead, Chris Pemberton encourages you to focus on making the journey of life a colourful one and to create the mental space needed to open your mind to its infinite possibilities, as opposed to staying single-mindedly focus on one track. This way we can make sure all of the goals we are heading towards are in line with what drives us intrinsically. Chris believes the way to achieve this mindset is by exploring one's creativity. He shares his story of coming to this realisation, and the art projects he dived into that helped him discover the depths of his creative expression... and a psychedelic experience involving Ayahuasca. With an international experiment called Creative Mirror, Chris proves creativity exists in everyone, no matter their skill level. Chris is an electrician by trade, but his real passion lies in helping people lead more creative lives. As the founder of Humans of K Road and now Humans for the Future, Chris focuses on bring humans from all walks of life together to share sustainable ideas and pursue their creative endeavours. His exhibition Creative Mirror is currently touring the world, inspiring people to unleash their inner creativity, by connecting them to different artists and opening up the art world.\n\nChris also founded the Crisp Creative Club in Australia, which holds sessions to help others improve their creative mindset. As the author of The Creative Soul, Chris believes “If it's the journey, not the destination, then we may as well make the journey as creative and colourful as possible”.

Lisa launched Eat My lunch with her business partner Michael Meredith in 2015. Their goal, for every meal purchased from them, a lunch would be donated to a New Zealand child who needs it. At the time of this videos upload, Eat My Lunch has donated 870,000+ lunches to kids in schools. In this talk, Lisa explains how her company uses the buy-one-give-one business model to help kids in need. Lisa King wants to ensure no child goes to school hungry.

Occupational therapist and founder of Rekindle, Juliet Arnott describes waste as not only a waste of earth’s resources, but also as a waste of ourselves and our capabilities. She offers resourcefulness as the solution.\n Juliet is the Founder and Director of Rekindle. Growing up on a small farm on the banks of the Wakamarina river in Marlborough, Juliet believes humans miss out on opportunities to be resourceful when they are wasteful due to consumerist lifestyles.\n\nShe started Rekindle in 2010 to create opportunities for resourcefulness. Since then, Rekindle has completed five major projects including using timber from damaged homes in the Christchurch Earthquake to create furniture, the first ever Whole House Reuse, and a nationwide project that enabled designers to focus on commercial waste. Rekindle’s current initiative is Resourceful Otautahi, offering workshops on resourceful skills using materials such as timber and fallen ti kouka leaves.

Psychologist and author, Michael Corballis explores the many theories of language's origins, including his own, and details how language and communication have continued to evolve, from primates' use of gestures, to the advent of communicative technologies. Michael Corballis, emeritus professor at the Department of Psychology at The University of Auckland is one of the foremost global experts on the evolution of human language. \n\nThe son of a sheep farmer from Marton, Michael’s long and decorated academic career has seen his studies of the brain and what it is to be human earn him New Zealand’s top science prize, The Rutherford Medal.\n\nHe has worked with patients who have had two-sides of their brains disconnected to relieve epilepsy which led him to look deeper into studying the two brain hemispheres. His most recent book The Truth About Language explores the idea that language evolved from manual gestures.

Cather Simpson explores how this became the focus of universities, and discusses her own evolution as a professor. \n\nOnce believing the purpose of universities was to generate learning and provide students with a philosophy of life, Cather now considers herself a 'three-pillar professor', believing universities can and should continue to do this, but also offer economic opportunities to their students when they move on into the workforce. Professor Cather Simpson, a physics and chemistry professor at the University of Auckland, wants to spark further innovation in our universities to boost economic benefit. As the director of the Photon Factory, she runs a high-tech laser lab which uses exotic pulsed lasers to help scientists from all realms and levels achieve their goals - whether to improve products in industry or even assist a science fair project. \n\nCurrently, her lab is studying anything from how molecules light into more useful forms of energy, to how to better sort sperm by sex for industry. \nWhen she’s not enjoying using lasers to solve the knotty problems presented by Mother Nature, she’s doing puzzles with her partner Tom and being taxi-mom to two engaging teenage boys.

As an artist, she has found that one way she explores this is through the use of her body with dance. Despite the discussed conflicts being incredibly personal to her, they are completely universal, as these are conflicts we can all admit to struggling with at one point, continually, or continuously. Jahra ends this talk with a moving and experimental piece that combines dance and poetry to express these ideas.  Jahra ‘Rager’ Wasasala is an award-winning cross-disciplinary artist of Fijian/NZ European descent. As an artist, Jahra investigates her ancestral connections through the art mediums of performance activation, contemporary dance and poetry, and has extensively toured her performance works both nationally and internationally.\n\nAs a child of the Pasifika diaspora, Jahra is invested in translating her shared internal conflict into an accessible, yet confrontational, physicalised language. Her most recent performance work titled “a world, with your wound in it” focuses on the complex relationship between the earth and a woman’s body, a theme Jahra continues to investigate in her developing work.\n\nJahra is known for her transcendent performance presence, otherworldly physicality and potent poetry, as well as her bold approach to political and social themes both on and off the stage. Jahra found her voice through the physical arts and believes that they are intrinsically tied to reclaiming autonomy, reconnecting to your ancestors and changing the world around you.

In one of most emotional speeches you will hear, Pete argues that we can all lead extraordinary and meaningful lives, but the key is to find and stand for a cause you truly believe in. From serving months in a maximum security prison for fighting Japanese whalers, to saving endangered red monkeys from poachers in the Amazon, Pete Bethune’s story will thrill, move, and inspire you.\n Pete Bethune takes conservation to the extreme. As the founder of Earthrace Conservation, Pete is a world record holder, circling the globe four times on his powerboat Earthrace. His missions have seen him shot at, run over by a Japanese security vessel, incarcerated in Libya and Japan, and held under armed guard in a Guatemalan Military camp.\n\nAs the producer of his show ‘The Operatives’, Pete runs a team of former special forces operatives to combat wildlife poaching, smuggling and illegal fishing in Africa, Asia and Central America. He also works closely with government enforcement units training them in coastal surveillance and hostile vessel takedown. At the heart of it all, Pete is a ship captain with an environmental edge.
