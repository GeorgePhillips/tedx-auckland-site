##### One of the most commonly asked questions posed to us at TEDxAuckland is *“how do you select your speakers?”*.

Based on the many random pitches we got only 3 days before the event, it occurred to me that a lot of people had the wrong idea about how much work was involved. And I don’t blame them, especially because the answer is more complicated than many people would think.

Now, with the 2018 event wrapped, I’d like to try explaining it.

I first became part of the TEDxAkl team as a video editor, late December 2017. The 2017 event had just occurred, and as a recent graduate looking for projects to save myself from post-uni emptiness, I jumped at the opportunity to edit the talks. However, these were talks I hadn’t seen performed live, from speakers I had never met.

Editing all of the incredible talks from 2017 meant watching them again and again, and as a result, I became extraordinarily familiar with the final product of the speakers’ ideas, yet knew nothing of the process that lead to it.&nbsp;[*Watch the 2017 talks here.*](https://youtu.be/EKBKqcaHOIg?list=PLcm2pIIAwlDtn58jNUEqyRUgUuNJ8Qjdd){: target="_blank"}

When becoming a co-organiser of TEDxAuckland, I finally got insight into the selection process and what went into developing each idea into one that would suit the TEDx platform, and represent the ethos of TEDxAuckland accurately.

How the speakers were selected varied, but all were chosen based on the same thing - their idea. Very rarely was it the one they first put forward.

Some people, like [Andrew Barnes](https://tedxauckland.com/people/andrew-barnes/){: target="_blank"}, [Sarah Strong](https://tedxauckland.com/people/sarah/){: target="_blank"}, and [Daniel Gudsell](https://tedxauckland.com/people/daniel-gudsell/){: target="_blank"}, were selected from the hundreds of applications sent to ideas@tedxauckland.com. Speaker team [Elliott Blade](https://tedxauckland.com/an-interview-with-elliott-blade-tedxauckland-licensee/){: target="_blank"}, Georgina Robert, and Ah Shin Park reviewed each of these proposed ideas, then met with those who they felt may offer something totally unique and important.

This often happened over coffee (or a beer), and the idea was discussed further. No one was confirmed on the spot, and speakers that were eventually confirmed returned for several follow up meetings to develop their idea before a decision was finally made. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Other people, like [Pania Newton](https://tedxauckland.com/people/pania-newton/){: target="_blank"}, [Hemi Kelly](https://tedxauckland.com/people/hemi-kelly/){: target="_blank"}, and [Imche Fourie](https://tedxauckland.com/people/imche-fourie/){: target="_blank"}, we personally reached out to after being made aware of the work they were doing in their communities. Once again, none of these speakers were confirmed on the spot, and subsequent meetings were had to dive deeper into their ideas, to focus and refine them.

Then there were speakers, like [Zeshan Qureshi](https://tedxauckland.com/people/zeshan-qureshi/){: target="_blank"} and [Pete Ceglinski](https://tedxauckland.com/people/pete-ceglinski/){: target="_blank"}, who were brought to our attention from past speakers or friends of TEDxAuckland, or were people that we had been talking to for a few years regarding getting them to present an idea.

That was only half of the work.

The real surprise from the entire process came from the many practise sessions we had leading up to the event. It was in this environment that speakers could come in, not only to practise their talks, but also workshop their ideas together.

What you had was a group of thought leaders and inspirational people from multiple different communities being put in the same room to listen to each other's ideas. Of course amazing things were going to happen.

I saw the speakers and the TEDxAkl team interact and converse with each other, and these interactions went on to influence the final presentations. Friendships were formed, networks were created, and ideas continued to develop. With guidance from the rest of the TEDxAkl speaker team, advice and feedback was offered to each other, from performance tips, to restructuring and refining ideas. &nbsp;

Watching the talks evolve was rewarding for everyone, and those experiencing it for the first time were surprised by the environment they had been brought into. It wasn’t clinical or overly structured, like many speakers had expected. It was warm, friendly, and became a space that nurtured transformative conversation and connection.

All up, the process of speaker selection for 2018 took a few months, but I believe it will have an impact for years to come. Not just within society as a result of the final ideas presented on the platform, but also for the individuals involved, who have formed life-long friendships, and a learning experience that we will carry with us forever. &nbsp;
