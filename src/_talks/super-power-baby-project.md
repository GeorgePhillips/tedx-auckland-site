description_markdown: "This talk was given at a local TEDx event, produced independently
  of the TED Conferences. When her daughter Evie was born with a significant genetic
  imbalance, photographer Rachel Callander turned to language to look beyond her disabilities
  and instead see her \"superpowers.\" Rachel's talk describes how Evie inspired her
  to connect with and photograph other \"superpower babies.\"\r\n\r\nhttps://twitter.com/SuprPowrBabies\r\nhttps://www.superpowerbabyproject.org/\r\nhttp://tedxauckland.com/\n\nAfter
  losing her daughter Evie, who had a rare chromosome condition, award winning NZ
  Wedding and Portrait photographer Rachel Callander turned her talent to capturing
  the beauty and abilities of other children with ‘Super Powers’.\r\n\r\nRachel has
  traveled the length and breadth of NZ meeting ordinary families being made extraordinary
  through the journeys their children are taking them on.\r\n\r\nAs a result of her
  travels, Rachel’s insights and images offer a fresh understanding and language regarding
  disability. The stunning photographs of the children alongside the conversations
  with their parents are presented in the Super Power Baby Project, a photographic
  art book due for launch in August 2014.\r\n\r\nThe Super Power Baby Project is a
  life affirming work. It does not shy from the notion that genetic syndromes bring
  with them their share of challenge, grief and difficulty. The strong message is
  though that there is much that lies beyond that. Rachel demonstrates that these
  children have much to teach us about themselves and ourselves, which is to be celebrated
  as truly exceptional.\n\nAbout TEDx, x = independently organized event In the spirit
  of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that
  bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks
  video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small
  group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently
  organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program,
  but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations)"
