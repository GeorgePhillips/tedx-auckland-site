title: Mapping by drone - Africa to Antartica
youtube_video_id: irtsSSek1k8
description_markdown: "While some drones are used to destroy, Barbara's team uses
  them – complete with military guidance technology – to map threatened ecosystems
  in Africa, Australia and Antarctica.\n\nBarbara is a senior lecturer in the School
  of Applied Sciences at Auckland University of Technology and has over 20 years’
  experience working in government and NGO’s.\r\n\r\nHer research and personal interests
  are in geography, ecosystem management, cultural landscapes and spatial ecology.
  Her research focus has been the identification, selection and management of Protected
  Areas, using geospatial sciences and novel remote sensing technology, such as drones,
  to map habitats and landscapes for conservation planning.\r\n\r\nBarbara’s work
  has taken her to some of the world’s most remote and unique ecosystems including
  desert systems in both Antarctica and the Namibia. She is a self confessed techno-nerd
  and is an advocate for the effective use of drones for good in NZ and beyond.\n\nThis
  talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently
  organized by a local community. Learn more at http://ted.com/tedx"
