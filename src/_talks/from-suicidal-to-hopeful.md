It was one conversation that changed and ultimately saved Jazz Thornton's life. She learnt the vital difference between surviving and fighting and now shares the practical ways she fought through 9 years of suicidal tendencies. Jazz has since co-founded mental health charity Voices of Hope with the purpose of providing hope and provoking change. Voices of hope has since gained international recognition for its video content and campaigns. Struggling and need to talk?
