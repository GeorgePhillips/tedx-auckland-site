title: Digital Me and the rise of precision medicine
youtube_video_id: Q48dXVTC03o
description_markdown: "Our bodies contain two terabytes of data. What if everyone
  involved in our healthcare – including us – could access that data and use it to
  make better lifestyle and treatment decisions? Precision medicine aims to answer
  that question and turn information into better health outcomes for everyone.\n\nIan
  began his professional career employed as a scientist writing mathematical models
  of the human body, before moving into the commercial world. In 1993 he founded Orion
  Health with a team of just four people and has grown the company to over 1,250 staff
  in 27 offices worldwide, enabling healthcare to more than 90 million patients worldwide.\r\n\r\nIan
  is passionate about the role that technology can play in enabling highly personalised
  care for individuals through the practice of precision medicine – using personal
  healthcare information that is captured and made available in real time. This technology
  will transform the practice of medicine into a mathematical science, and for a lapsed
  mathematician like Ian that means the health sector just got a whole lot more interesting.\n\nThis
  talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently
  organized by a local community. Learn more at http://ted.com/tedx"
