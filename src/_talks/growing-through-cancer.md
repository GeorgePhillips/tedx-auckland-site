description_markdown: "This talk was given at a local TEDx event, produced independently
  of the TED Conferences. Rebecca has embraced a lifestyle of wellbeing as well as
  connecting with and supporting other women facing cancer. A chance friendship with
  raw foods “unbakery” Little Bird founder Megan May, buying a Vitamix and the essential
  addition of yoga marked a turning point in Rebecca’s journey and she has recently
  opened a yoga and wellness hub in Auckland. The Centre combines yoga, naturopathy,
  meditation, massage, acupuncture and nutrition and offers free programmes for women
  with cancer.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.the-centre.co.nz\r\nhttp://tedxauckland.com\n\nRebecca

  event In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized
  events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event,
  TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection
  in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x =
  independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance
  for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject
