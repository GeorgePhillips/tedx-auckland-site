title: Putting human caring back into social services
youtube_video_id: SgguRmmHbgA
description_markdown: "Richard took over the reins of Big Buddy in 2002. His belief
  is the strength of human caring; he believes passionately that humans step up with
  less bureaucracy, judgement or expectation to make far better outcomes socially
  for us all.\n\nRichard put his IT and business skills to good use when he bailed
  out of the corporate world and took over the reins of Big Buddy in 2002. It’s taken
  focus, will-power and trust to grow an organisation that matches male volunteers
  with fatherless boys.\r\n\r\nBut Richard’s source lies in the values of the hippy
  movement he grew out of – his strongest belief is around the strength of human caring;
  he believes passionately that most anyone and anything can be healed when humans
  step up to care deeply for each other without judgement or expectation.\r\n\r\nRichard
  is also chair of Consumer NZ, a Vodafone World of Difference award winner and is
  a passionate father, grandfather, celebrant, gardener and author.\n\nThis talk was
  given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized
  by a local community. Learn more at http://ted.com/tedx"
